# Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users

This repository contains my two best solutions for the **Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users**. The competition involved predicting house prices based on a variety of features.

## Overview

In this competition, the goal was to build a regression model that could predict the final price of homes based on the provided dataset. I worked extensively on feature engineering and model tuning to achieve the best results.

### Solutions

I submitted two solutions with the following public leaderboard scores:
- **Solution 1**: 18205.37023
- **Solution 2**: 15107.49382

Both solutions were created using Python, leveraging libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `XGBoost`. 

## Contents

- `solution_1.ipynb`: Notebook containing the code and approach for the solution with a public score of 18205.37023.
- `solution_2.ipynb`: Notebook containing the code and approach for the solution with a public score of 15107.49382.
- `home-data-for-ml-course`: Directory for housing price data files.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, you will need the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`

You can install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-coursee).
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the solutions.
